                        <p>To maximise all the benefits of your new studs,<b> you’ll want to make sure that they’re the right size. </b></p>
                            <p>Generally, your football studs should have a snug, almost sock-like fit on your foot, but with enough room in the front to comfortably wiggle your toes.</p>
                            <p>In well-fitting football boots you’ll have <b>freedom of movement, enhanced touch and control on the ball</b>, and stability for your feet and ankles. Studs that are too tight can give you blisters, while loose-fitting studs leave your ankles vulnerable to injury. </p>
                            <p>Ready to hit the field? Shop online for football footwear from adidas and find studs and indoor football boots to match every game.</p>
