                    <h1>Exercises For Ankle Strength</h1>
                    <p>Give some love to your ankles—your powerhouse joints for balance and stability. Learn five ankle stability exercises with physical therapist Josh Davis.</p>
                    <h3>Why Is Ankle Strengthening Important?</h3>
                    <p>We all know strength exercises are beneficial, but have you ever thought to strengthen your ankles? This often-forgotten joint is crucial for a well-balanced, strong body for all. “Everybody can benefit from ankle strengthening,” said Josh Davis, a physical therapist in Portland, Oregon. Davis sees many youth to professional athletes for ankle injuries—especially those who encounter repetitive movements like dancers and runners. But he also sees older people who may have lost some muscle mass over time. By working to strengthen your ankles with exercises like the ones below, you’re improving your physical health and longevity overall.
 
                        Similar to exercises for stronger knees, Davis’s methods for stabilizing ankles involve working your entire lower leg and foot. “The muscles around the lower leg and ankle are going to help support, improve your balance and proprioception, prevent any falls, improve your stability and allow you to absorb impact,” said Davis.
                         
                        Here are five ankle stability exercises provided by Davis for you to try. Mix them into your usual workout, or give them a go while watching TV.</p>

                    <p>These ankle stability exercises are some quick and easy ways to get stronger every day. You can slip them in as a warmup or a cooldown to your usual workout—or try moves like calf and toe raises while brushing your teeth. Whichever way you decide, Davis suggests doing exercises for ankle strength at least two to three days a week.
 
                        You can also use your usual strength workouts as opportunities to strengthen ankles and balance. “Any time that you take a strength movement such as a squat, deadlift, or a lunge and you do it in a single-leg capacity, you are also strengthening all the muscles of the foot, ankle, calf, and your balance and proprioception. So that's why as a trainer and physical therapist, I always recommend that you have a good variety of single-leg training,” said Davis. The single-leg deadlift is a great place to start but see where in your training you can work in some more ankle exercises to become stronger and balanced overall.</p>
